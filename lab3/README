Contents: 
AE-Lib/  The automated testing framework library uVision project.
include/ The RTX API, board support package, and automated testing suite header files folder. 
RTX-APP/ The RTX application skelton project which includes the kernel.

lab3_report.csv: Lab1 report template file.
rtx.uvmpw: the multi-project workspace profile that contains both the AE-Lib and RTX-App projects. 

We have 3 test files. Relevant files are mailbox.c/.h and k_msg.c/.h, along with the test of the .c/.h files in the kernel from Lab 1

Note that ae_tasks_mbx_cmd_reg.c is a testing file that is meant to test Command Registration. The test registers G to a task, and then waits for commands like %GP.

**NOTE:** Our test logs on SIM, values may vary on RAM but the tests will still pass.
